# Welcome to the "Ma'akaf" Community!
### Open Source Community in Israel üåê

**Join us on Discord:** <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/WxqmcKfD5R">Click here</a>

#### Why Contribute to Open Source?

**Experienced Developers?** By contributing to open source, other experienced developers in various technologies will review your code and provide you with valuable feedback, pushing you forward.

**Juniors?** In addition to learning and improving your skills, contributing to open source is the closest thing to real-world experience you can gain on your own. Code you write that passes a code review by a senior in the industry adds significantly to your resume and demonstrates your high-level coding skills.

#### Why Join the Community?

**Introduce Yourself and Meet Others:** The community is built on personal connections. We would be happy if you share what you're looking for and your abilities.

**Get Involved in Suitable Projects:** Community projects are organized by languages and different technologies. You can easily find a project that interests you and use your favorite technologies.

**Build Relationships:** We encourage community members to share their social networks (e.g., LinkedIn) to create new connections.

**Professional Development:** Want to become a professional in open source? We're here to help. We have tutorial channels and people who can guide you.

#### How to Contribute Code?

If you've never contributed to open source before, you can practice your first contribution with us (simply adding a text file to a project). We've created a special [experimental project](https://github.com/UrielOfir/os-practice) where you can make code contributions to learn how code contributions work on GitHub. There is also a [detailed guide explaining how to contribute to this project](https://github.com/UrielOfir/os-practice).
